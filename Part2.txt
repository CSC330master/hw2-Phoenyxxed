1.Some of the Linux commands that I used are ls -ltr which lists one file per line, sorts by modification time, and reverses the order all at the same time and then outputs the files in the directory.
2.Some of the git commands I used were git config, git clone, add, status, commit and push. Config sets up the username, email and preferences. Clone copies a remote repo onto the VM. Add stages changes for commit. Commit saves staged changes with a message. Status shows the current state of the working directory. Finally, push uploads commits to a remote repository.
3.i. The rule for collaboration is that you can discuss ideas with our classmate but you cannot do homework with people outside your group. If you collaborate with someone you must write that out in a document and then submit it. You are encouraged to work on these assignments in pairs (unless otherwise specified), but you also have the choice to work on them individually. If you choose to work in a pair, both students will receive the same grade.
ii. You cannot use generative AI like ChatGPT, but you can use any available resource, printed or online. If you use any outside resources, then you must submit a document with the resources listed and if you didn’t use any resources then you must state that in your document.
iii. Late assignments will be accepted; however, there will be a penalty of 10% per day for submitting late assignments. Exceptions will be granted on an individual basis, and only for extreme circumstances.
iv. Part of the grade is based on your engagement and active participation during the semester. If you miss class, then you may miss out on the in-class exercise and will not be able to fill out the exit ticket. You also won’t gain the knowledge from that lecture.
